I go and get a margherita pizza, eat it and write down how it makes me feel (and some other stuff).

_Why margherita?_

Because I like cheese and tomato.

_What is the difference between italian and american pizza?_

American has more cheese, often more toppings and thicker crust *usually*. Italian has less cheese, often fewer toppings and a thin crust *usually*. Those categories are really general but probably the most useful for quickly describing what kind of pizza a pizzeria makes.

_Who are you?_

A guy who likes pizza. I don't have my pizza degree though so don't take anything I say seriously.
